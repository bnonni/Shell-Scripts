# UNIX = POWER USERS! 

This repo is for all those who are curious about how to better understand the UNIX operating system, how to use the terminal, basic terminal utilities, utilities for power users, practice docs and educational slides. Enjoy! :)

## [UNIX](Slides/UNIX/)

* 1. [UNIX Root Structure](Slides/UNIX/UNIX-Root-structure.pdf) - Visual representation of the file folder structure of a UNIX-based OS

* 2. [What is](Slides/UNIX/What-is-UNIX?.pdf) - Visual representation of the file folder structure of a UNIX-based OS

* Use route decorators to define the following endpoints:

  * `/`, or your **index route**: This should return a simple string, such as `"Hello, world!"`, or `"Welcome to my API!"`

  * `/about`, which should return a string containing your **name** and **current location**.

  * `/contact`, which should return a string telling visitors where to email you.

* Finally, add code at the bottom of the file that allows you to run the server from the command line with: `python app.py`.

## Hints

* Refer to the [Flask documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/quickstart/#a-minimal-application) as you work through this activity.
